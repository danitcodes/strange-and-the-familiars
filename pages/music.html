          <h4 class="music-h4">Spider's Song</h4>
          <p>
            I’d been sitting on my porch watching a spider sitting in a web that she’d constructed across the steps to my front porch, when a sharp wind blew and a dead leaf attached itself to the middle.
          </p>
          <p>
            She excitedly moved towards it to investigate, her frustrated cursing reaching my ears as she probed it with her sharp legs and realized it wasn’t dinner.
          </p>
          <p>
            She moved quickly and methodically around the leaf, releasing each strand that held it until it dropped to the ground, sealing up the hole like she’d done a thousand times before.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the excitement passed she retreated back into a shadowy corner and started humming a tune that sounded familiar. I asked her, “Why do you build your web across my front stairs Spider, where there is so much wind and traffic? There are so many places out of the way that wouldn’t force you to rebuild all the time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She sighed patiently and it sounded like dry leaves blowing across asphalt. She said ”You know the answer to that better than most Strange One. Hunger brings me here. I can live with the wind as long as I live.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt the weight of her silk strings, and how they shook beneath her; her tenuous patience with me, so young and full of questions. She began humming her familiar tune again.
          </p>
          <p>
            She didn’t have much to say, but I found her song held rumblings of things to come.

          <p>
            He stared out the windshield as we drove down the highway and said to me, "Do you remember when there were bugs?"
            "...like how your windshield used to be covered in bugs after a long drive?"
          </p>
          <p>
            I surveyed his perfectly clear windshield, a corpse-free zone, and nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            We drove on for a while and he said "Too many pesticides now. No bugs, no birds."
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at him, thinking about birds.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few minutes later he cut the silence again. "Do you remember how many butterflies there used to be? Big monarchs, and those little yellow ones?" He held his fingers apart an inch. "They were everywhere."
          </p>
          <p>
            The back of his truck rattled and dark silhouettes of tall trees sailed past us and the asphalt rolled out behind us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pieces of memories swam in and out of my head until a distinct image bullied its way in, clear as the view out of his windshield.
          </p>
          <p>
            I turned to him. "You never saw lightning bugs did you?"
          </p>
          <p>
            He shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            "They used to come out on summer nights when it was muggy. Their lights blink on and off real slow. It’s like magic.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We drove on in silence, feeling the quiet ache of irrefutable loss.

          <p>
            They came in groups of three.<br/>
            Nightmares always do.<br/>
            Don’t ask me why, I don’t know.<br/>
            There’s so much I don’t know.<br/>
            What I do know is that they came to help us.<br/>
            They’re here to help fight the uncontrolled fears that coalesce while we sleep,<br/>
            plaguing us in our waking hours, robbing us of rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nina was the youngest of the three, arguably the most wicked.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can’t say why she chose me.<br/>
            Maybe it’s because I have an uphill battle ahead of me, lifting the veil, sharing messages from voices unheard.<br/>
            Maybe it’s because I was strange enough to see her as she really was.<br/>
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the answer, she walked by my side for seven years, a Familiar, a friend, and a Nightmare to the end.

          <p>In high school I was in a play called This is A Test. It was about a boy taking a test and letting his mind get the best of him.
          </p>
          <p>
          Over and over again, we repeated the phrase “This is a Test. A what? A Test. A what? A Test. Oh, a Test”.
          </p>
          <p>
          By the end of the play everyone was glad to throw away their scripts and never ever revisit the one-scene comedy again. And still, so many years later I hear the phrase repeat like an alarm in my head.
